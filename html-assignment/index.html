                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>
                    I am from Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy <abbr title="Three-dimensional printing">3-D printing</abbr> 
                    and <abbr title="light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation">LASER</abbr> engraving.
                    I love the process of coming up with an idea and making it come to life through 
                    3-D printing and LASER engraving. I also like to play chess but <em>only</em> in person with a human. 
                    My favourite compound is H<sub>2</sub>O and I believe in avoiding 
                    its waste when possible. I value <em>family</em>, <em>friends</em>, <em>nature</em>, <em>good humor</em>
                    and <em>education</em>.
                </p>

                <h3>Academic Life</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy logic, <abbr title="mathematics">math</abbr> and computer based subjects. I have been a student in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. 
                    My journey at Algonquin College began on January 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022. Each course has me excited, my favourites being Digital Graphics and Web Development. 
                    Also, I find Introduction to Photography challenging but interesting. I like learning online and find myself <em>more</em> productive and <em>less</em> distracted
                    when learning online.    
                </p>
                <h3>Motivational Quote</h3>
