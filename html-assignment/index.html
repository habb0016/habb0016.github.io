            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>
                I am from Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy <abbr title="Three-dimensional printing">3-D printing</abbr> 
                and <abbr title="light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation">LASER</abbr> engraving.
                I love the process of coming up with an idea and making it come to life through 
                3-D printing and LASER engraving. I also like to play chess, but <em>only</em> in person, with a human. 
                My favourite compound is H<sub>2</sub>O and I believe in avoiding 
                its waste when possible. I value <em>family</em>, <em>friends</em>, <em>nature</em>, <em>good humor</em>
                and <em>education</em>.

            <h3>Academic Life</h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy logic, <abbr title="mathematics">math</abbr> and computer-based subjects. I am a student in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. 
                My journey at Algonquin College began on January 10<sup>th</sup>, 2022. Each course has me excited, my favourites being Digital Graphics and Web Development. 
                Also, I find Introduction to Photography challenging but interesting. I like learning online and find myself <em>more</em> productive and <em>less</em> distracted
                when learning online.
